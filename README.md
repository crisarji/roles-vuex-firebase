# About this project

Hello again developer pal!, if you have come across this repo on purpose great! thanks for reading, otherwise, maybe you want to take a look at its predecesor [login-vuex-firebase](https://github.com/crisarji/login-vuex-firebase), and if you have a chance, perhaps you can take a look at the post created for it right [here](https://dev.to/crisarji/authentication-with-vue-x-firebase-31dc).

Anyway, let me tell you that this repo is the next step to the authentication, yes, this is for the authorization; it is a simple one using an assigned role for some users by email. I can bet that there are several ways to do it, I wont go to deep cause:
 
 1. Want to give you a sample, you are allowed to fork and reimplement as much as you want/require.
 2. These are my first posts so I am taking it easy.
 3. Any feedback is more than welcome as a PR or thread in the post(I'll be adding the link as soon as I publish it) 

If you checked my aforementioned code and post, you remember we ended up having a functional authentication like this:

</p>
<br/>

So far so good!, but what would happen if you want to limitate the access to the users?, depending whether dealing with an `admin` or a `player`(yeap these are the couple roles we could have for this case).

We want to have a way to allow certain views to the `admin` and some others to the `player`, something like this:

<br/>
<h3>Admin</h3>
<p>Allow the access as an administrator to a <strong>dashboard</strong> page, but forbid to access other users page</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="90%" src="./src/assets/visuals/login-admin.gif" alt="Login Slideshow">
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>Allow the access as a player to a <strong>landing</strong> page, but forbid to access admin pages</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="90%" src="./src/assets/visuals/login-player.gif" alt="Login Slideshow">
</p>
<br/>
